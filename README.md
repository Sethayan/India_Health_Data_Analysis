##  Project Description

Motivation

Government departments hold vast amounts of key data across areas such as healthcare, infrastructure, and economics. However, much of this data is stored in formats that are difficult for the public to consume and not ideal for policy makers. With initiatives like Digital India, the volume of digitized data is growing rapidly, but accessibility and usability remains a challenge.

Problem Statement
This project aims to address these issues by focusing on the visualization of healthcare data. We have built a web application to present this data in a clear and interactive manner. The goal is to make raw datasets easier to interpret, enabling both citizens and policymakers to derive meaningful insights quickly.
